# Sleeping Beauties

This R and javascript code reads a citation report from Web of Science that has been manually processed (header removed, graphs removed) and creates d3.js graph intended to show "sleeping beauties," articles that go a relatively long time before starting to accumulate citations.

For more detail, see [this post](http://jgoodwin.net/blog/sleeping-beauties) and (Kieran Healy's post)[https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2015/06/27/sleeping-beauties-in-philosophy/].

# TODO

1. Automate read procedure so that it doesn't require manual spreadsheet tweaking.
2. Fix graphing function from R.
3. Regularize capitalization of titles.
4. Emphasize journal title.
5. Clean and indent js code properly.
6. Fix r function so that it accurately identifies "sleeping beauties" and "early wakers" according to user-defined criteria. Integrate into graphing code.
